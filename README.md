# sata

**sata** is a *Synchronous Alternative to Ajax*

**sata** is a quick and easy (and *Ajax*-free) way to send data from a client-side script to be processed by a server-side script which then redirects the browser to a URL which contains the server-side script's response.

Unlike *Ajax*, **sata** returns a response in the URI as a series of coded or uncoded key-value pairs in the URL, rather than returning a .responseText or .responseXML.
